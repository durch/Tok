Toks is an universal iOS game of induction. The goal is to infer connections between the elements and use that knowledge to make them all the same colour. Designed to be minimalist and visually simple yet beautiful.

The game starts of easy with only four Toks and a few connections but complexity quickly mounts up. The game itself is extremely easy to learn, almost impossible to master.

All Toks boards are generated procedurally meaning you can always practice your induction on fresh lower complexity games before testing it on more challenging boards. Behind the scenes Toks guarantees that each generated board is solvable, so at no should you be concerned that you are charging at windmills :).
Difficulty progression allows children to learn about basic relationships and inference, at the same time higher settings might just frustrate you enough to throw your device, against a soft surface please ;).

Soundtrack is composed of public domain works of Django Reinhardt, the varied pace and themes should make for an engrossing listening experience on its own.
