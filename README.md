# Tok

is a unique puzzle experience. The goal of each game is to figure out the relationships between presented toks and align all their colours.

Extremely easy to learn, almost impossible to master, especially at higher difficulties. Every Tok board is a uniquely tailored experience.

Difficulty progression allows children to learn about basic relationships and inference, at the same time higher settings might just frustrate you enough to throw your device ( against a soft surface please ;) ).

Even tough each board configuration is unique all are guaranteed to be solvable.

Your achievements are easily tracked through Game Center, challenge your friends, but be nice, they might be on a different level than you :)
